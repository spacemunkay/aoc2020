# First, we should start `inets` application.
# `httpc` is part of it:
Application.ensure_all_started(:inets)

# We should start `ssl` application also,
# if we want to make secure requests:
Application.ensure_all_started(:ssl)

# Now we can make request:
{:ok, {{'HTTP/1.1', 200, 'OK'}, _headers, _body}} =
  :httpc.request(:get, {'http://google.com', []}, [], [])
